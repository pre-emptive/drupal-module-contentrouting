Content Routing

This module provides a "Related Content" box. The links it provides are calculated using the index built by the core Search module. Related content is determined by calculating scores of words that appear in the current document and others on the system.

Content Routing is mostly achieved by a cron task, so the system must have a reasonably frequent cron, and also must have the Search module enabled.
